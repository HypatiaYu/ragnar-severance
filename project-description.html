                <h2>What is Ragnarök?</h2>
                <p>Ragnarök: the Severance of Body and Mind is a visual metaphor for the fracture between body and mind during mental illness. Nine concentric pentagons form a fractal spiral of the Nine Realms, with the brain as Asgard, symbolizing neural collapse, rupture, and the possibility of renewal.</p>
                
                <h3>Physical Description</h3>
                <p>The sculpture is composed of five concentric pentagonal forms that rise in a continuous spiral, reaching approximately 10 feet at the highest corner. Each pentagonal face is constructed entirely from triangular elements, with faces defined by the edges of those triangles rather than flat planes.</p>
                <p>Within each triangle, smaller triangular cutouts are arranged to create a fractal pattern, repeating the triangular geometry at multiple scales. One edge of each pentagon is intentionally left open, and these openings align to form a spiraling pathway that leads inward through the structure.</p>
                <p>The design emphasizes both visual and physical accessibility. The spiral remains clearly legible from the exterior while also allowing viewers to enter and move through the interior space, experiencing the fractal geometry from within. The interplay of edges, voids, and repeating triangular forms creates shifting perspectives as the viewer navigates the sculpture, reinforcing the sense of depth, motion, and self-similarity.</p>

                <h2>Interactivity</h2>
                <p>The installation is composed of five concentric pentagonal forms built from interlocking triangular fractals, arranged as a continuous pentagonal spiral. Between each layer, a central spiral pathway opens, creating spaces for participants to enter, move, and dance within the structure. Large triangular apertures in the outer pentagon allow visitors to climb through the walls, inviting multiple points of access and non-linear exploration. Participants may travel freely from the outer pentagon toward the inner center.</p>
                <p>At night, the sculpture is activated by laser-based projection, illuminating its surfaces with shifting psychedelic fractal patterns. These projected images transform the structure into an immersive, dreamlike environment, allowing participants to dance through a constantly evolving field of light and geometry. The experience is designed to evoke the sensation of a psychedelic journey, where movement, perception, and spatial orientation dissolve into a shared, embodied exploration.</p>

                <h2>Philosophy of Piece</h2>
                <p>Ragnarök: Severance of Body and Mind is a visual metaphor for the fracture between body and mind experienced during mental illness. Nine concentric pentagons form a fractal spiral referencing the Nine Realms, with the brain positioned as Asgard, symbolizing neural collapse, rupture, and the possibility of renewal.</p>
                <p>Ragnarök is a speculative anatomical and mythological artwork that reimagines the human nervous system as the physical embodiment of the axis mundi—the sacred world axis connecting body, mind, and cosmos. Rather than presenting the nervous system as a linear network, the piece renders it as a series of interconnected pentagons arranged in a spiral, simultaneously evoking neural pathways, cosmic structure, and Norse cosmology.</p>
                <p>At the center of the spiral lies Asgard, which represents the brain—the core of perception, memory, and decision-making. From this central square radiate the remaining eight units, mapped along the spiral as extensions of the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. These outer pentagons symbolize the transmission of thought, emotion, and sensation outward into the body and back again, forming a recursive loop between awareness and physical experience.</p>
                <p>The spiral structure reflects both growth and recurrence, suggesting that consciousness does not move forward in a straight line but cycles through repeated phases of collapse and regeneration. The installation is physically complete yet conceptually unfinished without participation. Multiple concentric spiral layers create interior spaces that invite viewers to enter the work, move through it, and inhabit it bodily.</p>
                <p>Through movement and dance, participants activate the work, embodying the cycles of dissolution and renewal that define both Ragnarök and psychological experience. Mental illness is framed not as pathology but as a personal Ragnarök—an internal apocalypse marked by disintegration that carries the potential for transformation. Depression, anxiety, mania, and recovery become movements along the spiral, moments of rupture and reorganization within the same living system.</p>
                <p>Healing, the work suggests, does not mean escaping the cycle, but learning how to move through it with awareness. Ultimately, Ragnorak presents the human psyche as both fragile and sacred: a living axis that binds myth, mind, and body into a single, evolving universe.</p>
